## How to setup localy:

1. Download this repo
2. Download node.js (needed instantly
3. Install miniweb (Or if you have python, get a python script that can run localhost. This setup will run over how to setup with miniweb)
4. After installing node.js, go to repo folder, open cmd and do `npm install` (This gets all the dependencies)
5. After getting the dependencies, do `npm run build` If you dont see any red text, there should be a dist\ folder.
6. Goto dist\ and put all the contents into a folder `htdocs`
7. Put miniweb in the folder where `htdocs` is located
8. Run miniweb

It should be good to go now on `http://locahost:8080` or `localhost:8000`
(depends machine from machine, if one doesnt work try the other!
